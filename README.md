# ExchangeRate

Retrieves foreign exchange (FX) rates. ExchangeRate uses a cache for FX rates so you're not dependent on a constant connection to your FX rate provider of choice.

ExchangeRate has a pluggable backend for FX rate providers, so custom providers can be added with ease. Currently, ExchangeRate supports the following data sources:

- (90 day European Central Bank (ECB) feed)[http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-hist-90d.xml]

> We'd love to hear what other sources you use, and welcome pull-requests with additional backends.

Rates are stored locally in an SQLite database by default, which should be fine for development and single-instance production deployments. The library leverages ActiveRecord, so you can use another database of choice (see below).

## Requirements

1. Ruby > 2.5.0

## Installation
> TODO fix for non-rubygems release

```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install exchange_rate

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Local cache

Data is written to a local cache at `db/data.sqlite`. We use the [Sequel](https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel) ORM, so any compatible database can be used. A custom database can be defined using:


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
